However, I should clarify something important:\n\n**Claude Code doesn't have a traditional \"plugin\" system** in the way you might be thinking. Instead, here's what's actually available:\n\n## What Claude Code Offers:\n\n1. **Built-in Tools** - I have access to specific capabilities:\n   - File system operations (read, write, execute)\n   - Terminal/command execution\n   - Code analysis and generation\n   - Skill tools (like `keybindings-help` shown above)\n\n2. **Extensions/Skills** - Limited integrations that appear in my system instructions (like the keybindings tool)\n\n3. **Code Execution** - I can write and execute code in various languages directly\n\n## If You're Looking To:\n\n- **Customize keyboard shortcuts** → Use the `keybindings-help` skill\n- **Extend Claude's capabilities** → That's typically done via Claude's official API or integrations\n- **Use Claude in your own app** → Claude's API allows integration\n- **Automate workflows** → I can help write scripts you execute locally\n\n## What Would Actually Help:\n\nCould you clarify what you're trying to accomplish? Are you looking to:\n- Customize Claude Code's keybindings?\n- Integrate Claude into another tool?\n- Extend Claude's capabilities with custom functions?\n- Use external APIs/services with Claude?\n\nThis will help me give you accurate, actionable guidance!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":907,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXg4fu2mu4KJjkip6PvDq","type":"assistant","uuid":"a22f1a5f-3bdd-4fac-b199-d0d316d9acf0","timestamp":"2026-01-31T20:11:07.205Z"}
