However, I should clarify: **I'm Claude, made by Anthropic** — not \"PAI.\" \n\nCould you clarify what you mean by \"PAI workflows\"? Are you asking about:\n\n1. **Claude workflows** — how I process information and respond to requests?\n2. **A specific system called PAI** — perhaps a tool, platform, or framework you're using?\n3. **Agent workflows** — how AI agents like me structure decision-making and task execution?\n4. **Your personal workflows with me** — how you can best use Claude for productivity?\n\nOnce I understand what you're looking for, I can give you a much more useful explanation. Feel free to provide context about where you encountered \"PAI workflows\" or what problem you're trying to solve!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":901,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXgQu9b4tK9KvSdoqE4Hj","type":"assistant","uuid":"2b045300-f03d-4f43-aa74-8096e25b8873","timestamp":"2026-02-01T00:36:21.934Z"}
