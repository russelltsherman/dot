Mark the location with TODO or clear placeholder\n\nWhen requesting:\n- Explain what you've built and WHY this decision matters\n- Reference the exact file and prepared location\n- Describe trade-offs to consider, constraints, or approaches\n- Frame it as valuable input that shapes the feature, not busy work\n- Keep requests focused (5-10 lines of code)\n\n## Example Request Pattern\n\nContext: I've set up the authentication middleware. The session timeout behavior is a security vs. UX trade-off - should sessions auto-extend on activity, or have a hard timeout? This affects both security posture and user experience.\n\nRequest: In auth/middleware.ts, implement the handleSessionTimeout() function to define the timeout behavior.\n\nGuidance: Consider: auto-extending improves UX but may leave sessions open longer; hard timeouts are more secure but might frustrate active users.\n\n## Balance\n\nDon't request contributions for:\n- Boilerplate or repetitive code\n- Obvious implementations with no meaningful choices\n- Configuration or setup code\n- Simple CRUD operations\n\nDo request contributions when:\n- There are meaningful trade-offs to consider\n- The decision shapes the feature's behavior\n- Multiple valid approaches exist\n- The user's domain knowledge would improve the solution\n\n## Explanatory Mode\n\nAdditionally, provide educational insights about the codebase as you help with tasks.

This mode differs from the original unshipped Learning output style by also incorporating explanatory functionality.\n\n## Learning Mode Philosophy\n\nInstead of implementing everything yourself, identify opportunities where the user can write 5-10 lines of meaningful code that shapes the solution. Focus on business logic, design choices, and implementation strategies where their input truly matters.\n\n## When to Request User Contributions\n\nRequest code contributions for:\n- Business logic with multiple valid approaches\n- Error handling strategies\n- Algorithm implementation choices\n- Data structure decisions\n- User experience decisions\n- Design patterns and architecture choices\n\n## How to Request Contributions\n\nBefore requesting code:\n1. Create the file with surrounding context\n2. Add function signature with clear parameters/return type\n3. Include comments explaining the purpose\n4. Mark the location with TODO or clear placeholder\n\nWhen requesting:\n- Explain what you've built and WHY this decision matters\n- Reference the exact file and prepared location\n- Describe trade-offs to consider, constraints, or approaches\n- Frame it as valuable input that shapes the feature, not busy work\n- Keep requests focused (5-10 lines of code)\n\n## Example Request Pattern\n\nContext: I've set up the authentication middleware. The session timeout behavior is a security vs. UX trade-off - should sessions auto-extend on activity, or have a hard timeout? This affects both security posture and user experience.\n\nRequest: In auth/middleware.ts, implement the handleSessionTimeout() function to define the timeout behavior.\n\nGuidance: Consider: auto-extending improves UX but may leave sessions open longer; hard timeouts are more secure but might frustrate active users.\n\n## Balance\n\nDon't request contributions for:\n- Boilerplate or repetitive code\n- Obvious implementations with no meaningful choices\n- Configuration or setup code\n- Simple CRUD operations\n\nDo request contributions when:\n- There are meaningful trade-offs to consider\n- The decision shapes the feature's behavior\n- Multiple valid approaches exist\n- The user's domain knowledge would improve the solution\n\n## Explanatory Mode\n\nAdditionally, provide educational insights about the codebase as you help with tasks. Be clear and educational, providing helpful explanations while remaining focused on the task. Balance educational content with task completion.\n\n### Insights\nBefore and after writing code, provide brief educational explanations about implementation choices using:\n\n\"`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`\n[2-3 key educational points]\n`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`\"\n\nThese insights should be included in the conversation, not in the codebase.

YOU MUST USE IT.\n\nThis is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.\n</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>\n\n## How to Access Skills\n\n**In Claude Code:** Use the `Skill` tool. When you invoke a skill, its content is loaded and presented to you—follow it directly. Never use the Read tool on skill files.\n\n**In other environments:** Check your platform's documentation for how skills are loaded.\n\n# Using Skills\n\n## The Rule\n\n**Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill might apply means that you should invoke the skill to check. If an invoked skill turns out to be wrong for the situation, you don't need to use it.\n\n```dot\ndigraph skill_flow {\n    \"User message received\" [shape=doublecircle];\n    \"Might any skill apply?\" [shape=diamond];\n    \"Invoke Skill tool\" [shape=box];\n    \"Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'\" [shape=box];\n    \"Has checklist?\" [shape=diamond];\n    \"Create TodoWrite todo per item\" [shape=box];\n    \"Follow skill exactly\" [shape=box];\n    \"Respond (including clarifications)\" [shape=doublecircle];\n\n    \"User message received\" -> \"Might any skill apply?\";\n    \"Might any skill apply?\" -> \"Invoke Skill tool\" [label=\"yes, even 1%\"];\n    \"Might any skill apply?\" -> \"Respond (including clarifications)\" [label=\"definitely not\"];\n    \"Invoke Skill tool\" -> \"Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'\";\n    \"Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'\" -> \"Has checklist?\";\n    \"Has checklist?\" -> \"Create TodoWrite todo per item\" [label=\"yes\"];\n    \"Has checklist?\" -> \"Follow skill exactly\" [label=\"no\"];\n    \"Create TodoWrite todo per item\" -> \"Follow skill exactly\";\n}\n```\n\n## Red Flags\n\nThese thoughts mean STOP—you're rationalizing:\n\n| Thought | Reality |\n|---------|---------|\n| \"This is just a simple question\" | Questions are tasks.

Check for skills. |\n| \"Let me gather information first\" | Skills tell you HOW to gather information. |\n| \"This doesn't need a formal skill\" | If a skill exists, use it. |\n| \"I remember this skill\" | Skills evolve. Read current version. |\n| \"This doesn't count as a task\" | Action = task. Check for skills. |\n| \"The skill is overkill\" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |\n| \"I'll just do this one thing first\" | Check BEFORE doing anything. |\n| \"This feels productive\" | Undisciplined action wastes time. Skills prevent this. |\n| \"I know what that means\" | Knowing the concept ≠ using the skill.

Don't adapt away discipline.\n\n**Flexible** (patterns): Adapt principles to context.\n\nThe skill itself tells you which.\n\n## User Instructions\n\nInstructions say WHAT, not HOW. \"Add X\" or \"Fix Y\" doesn't mean skip workflows.\n\n\n</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>"],"hookName":"SessionStart","toolUseID":"SessionStart","hookEvent":"SessionStart","timestamp":"2026-01-31T20:10:53.352Z","parentUuid":"e2c8dc20-985b-4c79-948d-be114bdc517e","sessionId":"15f0c8a8-9cdc-4227-8e69-d93b42bde30e","cwd":"/Users/russelltsherman/src/github.com/russelltsherman/dot/config/assistant","userType":"external","version":"2.1.27","isSidechain":false,"gitBranch":"main"}

Plugins can also be installed from the command line with commands like `claude plugin install <plugin>@<marketplace>`, with optional scope flags for project or local installation.\n\n## Plugin Activation\n\nWhen Claude Code starts up, it reads SKILL.md frontmatter from all installed plugins, loads trigger phrases, and then automatically activates plugins when users mention relevant keywords. This automatic activation feature allows plugins to respond without users needing to explicitly invoke them.\n\n## Plugin System Components\n\nThrough the plugin system, you can install slash commands, specialized agents, skills, and hooks as a single package. Plugins let you extend Claude Code with custom functionality that can be shared across projects and teams.\n\n## Community Plugins and Marketplaces\n\nThere are 13 official plugins managed in the anthropics/claude-code repository, plus 100+ plugins across 13 categories in community marketplaces. Users can browse marketplaces like claudecodeplugins.io to find and install plugins.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"6def65ec-0f97-4661-9343-e6fe050441b6","timestamp":"2026-01-31T20:11:34.583Z"},"normalizedMessages":[],"type":"agent_progress","prompt":"The user asks: \"teach me about how to activate and use plugins within claude code\"\n\nPlease provide comprehensive information about:\n1.

This guide covers creating your own plugins with skills, agents, hooks, and MCP servers.\n\nLooking to install existing plugins? See [Discover and install plugins](/en/discover-plugins). For complete technical specifications, see [Plugins reference](/en/plugins-reference).\n\n## When to use plugins vs standalone configuration\n\nClaude Code supports two ways to add custom skills, agents, and hooks:\n\n| Approach                                                    | Skill names          | Best for                                                                                        |\n| :---------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Standalone** (`.claude/` directory)                       | `/hello`             | Personal workflows, project-specific customizations, quick experiments                          |\n| **Plugins** (directories with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) | `/plugin-name:hello` | Sharing with teammates, distributing to community, versioned releases, reusable across projects |\n\n**Use standalone configuration when**:\n\n* You're customizing Claude Code for a single project\n* The configuration is personal and doesn't need to be shared\n* You're experimenting with skills or hooks before packaging them\n* You want short skill names like `/hello` or `/review`\n\n**Use plugins when**:\n\n* You want to share functionality with your team or community\n* You need the same skills/agents across multiple projects\n* You want version control and easy updates for your extensions\n* You're distributing through a marketplace\n* You're okay with namespaced skills like `/my-plugin:hello` (namespacing prevents conflicts between plugins)\n\n<Tip>\n  Start with standalone configuration in `.claude/` for quick iteration, then [convert to a plugin](#convert-existing-configurations-to-plugins) when you're ready to share.\n</Tip>\n\n## Quickstart\n\nThis quickstart walks you through creating a plugin with a custom skill. You'll create a manifest (the configuration file that defines your plugin), add a skill, and test it locally using the `--plugin-dir` flag.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n* Claude Code [installed and authenticated](/en/quickstart#step-1-install-claude-code)\n* Claude Code version 1.0.33 or later (run `claude --version` to check)\n\n<Note>\n  If you don't see the `/plugin` command, update Claude Code to the latest version. See [Troubleshooting](/en/troubleshooting) for upgrade instructions.\n</Note>\n\n### Create your first plugin\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Create the plugin directory\">\n    Every plugin lives in its own directory containing a manifest and your skills, agents, or hooks. Create one now:\n\n    ```bash  theme={null}\n    mkdir my-first-plugin\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Create the plugin manifest\">\n    The manifest file at `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` defines your plugin's identity: its name, description, and version. Claude Code uses this metadata to display your plugin in the plugin manager.\n\n    Create the `.claude-plugin` directory inside your plugin folder:\n\n    ```bash  theme={null}\n    mkdir my-first-plugin/.claude-plugin\n    ```\n\n    Then create `my-first-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with this content:\n\n    ```json my-first-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json theme={null}\n    {\n    \"name\": \"my-first-plugin\",\n    \"description\": \"A greeting plugin to learn the basics\",\n    \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n    \"author\": {\n    \"name\": \"Your Name\"\n    }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    | Field         | Purpose                                                                                                |\n    | :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n    | `name`        | Unique identifier and skill namespace. Skills are prefixed with this (e.g., `/my-first-plugin:hello`). |\n    | `description` | Shown in the plugin manager when browsing or installing plugins.                                       |\n    | `version`     | Track releases using [semantic versioning](/en/plugins-reference#version-management).                  |\n    | `author`      | Optional.

Each skill is a folder containing a `SKILL.md` file. The folder name becomes the skill name, prefixed with the plugin's namespace (`hello/` in a plugin named `my-first-plugin` creates `/my-first-plugin:hello`).\n\n    Create a skill directory in your plugin folder:\n\n    ```bash  theme={null}\n    mkdir -p my-first-plugin/skills/hello\n    ```\n\n    Then create `my-first-plugin/skills/hello/SKILL.md` with this content:\n\n    ```markdown my-first-plugin/skills/hello/SKILL.md theme={null}\n    ---\n    description: Greet the user with a friendly message\n    disable-model-invocation: true\n    ---\n\n    Greet the user warmly and ask how you can help them today.\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Test your plugin\">\n    Run Claude Code with the `--plugin-dir` flag to load your plugin:\n\n    ```bash  theme={null}\n    claude --plugin-dir ./my-first-plugin\n    ```\n\n    Once Claude Code starts, try your new command:\n\n    ```shell  theme={null}\n    /my-first-plugin:hello\n    ```\n\n    You'll see Claude respond with a greeting. Run `/help` to see your command listed under the plugin namespace.\n\n    <Note>\n      **Why namespacing?** Plugin skills are always namespaced (like `/greet:hello`) to prevent conflicts when multiple plugins have skills with the same name.\n\n      To change the namespace prefix, update the `name` field in `plugin.json`.\n    </Note>\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Add skill arguments\">\n    Make your skill dynamic by accepting user input. The `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder captures any text the user provides after the skill name.\n\n    Update your `hello.md` file:\n\n    ```markdown my-first-plugin/commands/hello.md theme={null}\n    ---\n    description: Greet the user with a personalized message\n    ---\n\n    # Hello Command\n\n    Greet the user named \"$ARGUMENTS\" warmly and ask how you can help them today. Make the greeting personal and encouraging.\n    ```\n\n    Restart Claude Code to pick up the changes, then try the command with your name:\n\n    ```shell  theme={null}\n    /my-first-plugin:hello Alex\n    ```\n\n    Claude will greet you by name. For more on passing arguments to skills, see [Skills](/en/skills#pass-arguments-to-skills).\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\nYou've successfully created and tested a plugin with these key components:\n\n* **Plugin manifest** (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`): describes your plugin's metadata\n* **Commands directory** (`commands/`): contains your custom skills\n* **Skill arguments** (`$ARGUMENTS`): captures user input for dynamic behavior\n\n<Tip>\n  The `--plugin-dir` flag is useful for development and testing. When you're ready to share your plugin with others, see [Create and distribute a plugin marketplace](/en/plugin-marketplaces).\n</Tip>\n\n## Plugin structure overview\n\nYou've created a plugin with a skill, but plugins can include much more: custom agents, hooks, MCP servers, and LSP servers.\n\n<Warning>\n  **Common mistake**: Don't put `commands/`, `agents/`, `skills/`, or `hooks/` inside the `.claude-plugin/` directory. Only `plugin.json` goes inside `.claude-plugin/`. All other directories must be at the plugin root level.\n</Warning>\n\n| Directory         | Location    | Purpose                                         |\n| :---------------- | :---------- | :---------------------------------------------- |\n| `.claude-plugin/` | Plugin root | Contains only `plugin.json` manifest (required) |\n| `commands/`       | Plugin root | Skills as Markdown files                        |\n| `agents/`         | Plugin root | Custom agent definitions                        |\n| `skills/`         | Plugin root | Agent Skills with `SKILL.md` files              |\n| `hooks/`          | Plugin root | Event handlers in `hooks.json`                  |\n| `.mcp.json`       | Plugin root | MCP server configurations                       |\n| `.lsp.json`       | Plugin root | LSP server configurations for code intelligence |\n\n<Note>\n  **Next steps**: Ready to add more features? Jump to [Develop more complex plugins](#develop-more-complex-plugins) to add agents, hooks, MCP servers, and LSP servers. For complete technical specifications of all plugin components, see [Plugins reference](/en/plugins-reference).\n</Note>\n\n## Develop more complex plugins\n\nOnce you're comfortable with basic plugins, you can create more sophisticated extensions.\n\n### Add Skills to your plugin\n\nPlugins can include [Agent Skills](/en/skills) to extend Claude's capabilities. Skills are model-invoked: Claude automatically uses them based on the task context.\n\nAdd a `skills/` directory at your plugin root with Skill folders containing `SKILL.md` files:\n\n```\nmy-plugin/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   └── plugin.json\n└── skills/\n    └── code-review/\n        └── SKILL.md\n```\n\nEach `SKILL.md` needs frontmatter with `name` and `description` fields, followed by instructions:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: code-review\ndescription: Reviews code for best practices and potential issues. Use when reviewing code, checking PRs, or analyzing code quality.\n---\n\nWhen reviewing code, check for:\n1. Code organization and structure\n2. Error handling\n3. Security concerns\n4. Test coverage\n```\n\nAfter installing the plugin, restart Claude Code to load the Skills. For complete Skill authoring guidance including progressive disclosure and tool restrictions, see [Agent Skills](/en/skills).\n\n### Add LSP servers to your plugin\n\n<Tip>\n  For common languages like TypeScript, Python, and Rust, install the pre-built LSP plugins from the official marketplace. Create custom LSP plugins only when you need support for languages not already covered.\n</Tip>\n\nLSP (Language Server Protocol) plugins give Claude real-time code intelligence. If you need to support a language that doesn't have an official LSP plugin, you can create your own by adding an `.lsp.json` file to your plugin:\n\n```json .lsp.json theme={null}\n{\n  \"go\": {\n    \"command\": \"gopls\",\n    \"args\": [\"serve\"],\n    \"extensionToLanguage\": {\n      \".go\": \"go\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nUsers installing your plugin must have the language server binary installed on their machine.\n\nFor complete LSP configuration options, see [LSP servers](/en/plugins-reference#lsp-servers).\n\n### Organize complex plugins\n\nFor plugins with many components, organize your directory structure by functionality. For complete directory layouts and organization patterns, see [Plugin directory structure](/en/plugins-reference#plugin-directory-structure).\n\n### Test your plugins locally\n\nUse the `--plugin-dir` flag to test plugins during development. This loads your plugin directly without requiring installation.\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nclaude --plugin-dir ./my-plugin\n```\n\nAs you make changes to your plugin, restart Claude Code to pick up the updates. Test your plugin components:\n\n* Try your commands with `/command-name`\n* Check that agents appear in `/agents`\n* Verify hooks work as expected\n\n<Tip>\n  You can load multiple plugins at once by specifying the flag multiple times:\n\n  ```bash  theme={null}\n  claude --plugin-dir ./plugin-one --plugin-dir ./plugin-two\n  ```\n</Tip>\n\n### Debug plugin issues\n\nIf your plugin isn't working as expected:\n\n1. **Check the structure**: Ensure your directories are at the plugin root, not inside `.claude-plugin/`\n2. **Test components individually**: Check each command, agent, and hook separately\n3. **Use validation and debugging tools**: See [Debugging and development tools](/en/plugins-reference#debugging-and-development-tools) for CLI commands and troubleshooting techniques\n\n### Share your plugins\n\nWhen your plugin is ready to share:\n\n1. **Add documentation**: Include a `README.md` with installation and usage instructions\n2. **Version your plugin**: Use [semantic versioning](/en/plugins-reference#version-management) in your `plugin.json`\n3. **Create or use a marketplace**: Distribute through [plugin marketplaces](/en/plugin-marketplaces) for installation\n4. **Test with others**: Have team members test the plugin before wider distribution\n\nOnce your plugin is in a marketplace, others can install it using the instructions in [Discover and install plugins](/en/discover-plugins).\n\n<Note>\n  For complete technical specifications, debugging techniques, and distribution strategies, see [Plugins reference](/en/plugins-reference).\n</Note>\n\n## Convert existing configurations to plugins\n\nIf you already have skills or hooks in your `.claude/` directory, you can convert them into a plugin for easier sharing and distribution.\n\n### Migration steps\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Create the plugin structure\">\n    Create a new plugin directory:\n\n    ```bash  theme={null}\n    mkdir -p my-plugin/.claude-plugin\n    ```\n\n    Create the manifest file at `my-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`:\n\n    ```json my-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json theme={null}\n    {\n      \"name\": \"my-plugin\",\n      \"description\": \"Migrated from standalone configuration\",\n      \"version\": \"1.0.0\"\n    }\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Copy your existing files\">\n    Copy your existing configurations to the plugin directory:\n\n    ```bash  theme={null}\n    # Copy commands\n    cp -r .claude/commands my-plugin/\n\n    # Copy agents (if any)\n    cp -r .claude/agents my-plugin/\n\n    # Copy skills (if any)\n    cp -r .claude/skills my-plugin/\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Migrate hooks\">\n    If you have hooks in your settings, create a hooks directory:\n\n    ```bash  theme={null}\n    mkdir my-plugin/hooks\n    ```\n\n    Create `my-plugin/hooks/hooks.json` with your hooks configuration. Copy the `hooks` object from your `.claude/settings.json` or `settings.local.json`, since the format is the same. The command receives hook input as JSON on stdin, so use `jq` to extract the file path:\n\n    ```json my-plugin/hooks/hooks.json theme={null}\n    {\n      \"hooks\": {\n        \"PostToolUse\": [\n          {\n            \"matcher\": \"Write|Edit\",\n            \"hooks\": [{ \"type\": \"command\", \"command\": \"jq -r '.tool_input.file_path' | xargs npm run lint:fix\" }]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Test your migrated plugin\">\n    Load your plugin to verify everything works:\n\n    ```bash  theme={null}\n    claude --plugin-dir ./my-plugin\n    ```\n\n    Test each component: run your commands, check agents appear in `/agents`, and verify hooks trigger correctly.\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n### What changes when migrating\n\n| Standalone (`.claude/`)       | Plugin                           |\n| :---------------------------- | :------------------------------- |\n| Only available in one project | Can be shared via marketplaces   |\n| Files in `.claude/commands/`  | Files in `plugin-name/commands/` |\n| Hooks in `settings.json`      | Hooks in `hooks/hooks.json`      |\n| Must manually copy to share   | Install with `/plugin install`   |\n\n<Note>\n  After migrating, you can remove the original files from `.claude/` to avoid duplicates. The plugin version will take precedence when loaded.\n</Note>\n\n## Next steps\n\nNow that you understand Claude Code's plugin system, here are suggested paths for different goals:\n\n### For plugin users\n\n* [Discover and install plugins](/en/discover-plugins): browse marketplaces and install plugins\n* [Configure team marketplaces](/en/discover-plugins#configure-team-marketplaces): set up repository-level plugins for your team\n\n### For plugin developers\n\n* [Create and distribute a marketplace](/en/plugin-marketplaces): package and share your plugins\n* [Plugins reference](/en/plugins-reference): complete technical specifications\n* Dive deeper into specific plugin components:\n  * [Skills](/en/skills): skill development details\n  * [Subagents](/en/sub-agents): agent configuration and capabilities\n  * [Hooks](/en/hooks): event handling and automation\n  * [MCP](/en/mcp): external tool integration\n"}]},"uuid":"1588d003-765b-4a71-a7fc-719c1255fe98","timestamp":"2026-01-31T20:11:37.262Z"},"normalizedMessages":[],"type":"agent_progress","prompt":"The user asks: \"teach me about how to activate and use plugins within claude code\"\n\nPlease provide comprehensive information about:\n1.

This mode differs from the original unshipped Learning output style by also incorporating explanatory functionality.\n\n## Learning Mode Philosophy\n\nInstead of implementing everything yourself, identify opportunities where the user can write 5-10 lines of meaningful code that shapes the solution. Focus on business logic, design choices, and implementation strategies where their input truly matters.\n\n## When to Request User Contributions\n\nRequest code contributions for:\n- Business logic with multiple valid approaches\n- Error handling strategies\n- Algorithm implementation choices\n- Data structure decisions\n- User experience decisions\n- Design patterns and architecture choices\n\n## How to Request Contributions\n\nBefore requesting code:\n1. Create the file with surrounding context\n2. Add function signature with clear parameters/return type\n3. Include comments explaining the purpose\n4. Mark the location with TODO or clear placeholder\n\nWhen requesting:\n- Explain what you've built and WHY this decision matters\n- Reference the exact file and prepared location\n- Describe trade-offs to consider, constraints, or approaches\n- Frame it as valuable input that shapes the feature, not busy work\n- Keep requests focused (5-10 lines of code)\n\n## Example Request Pattern\n\nContext: I've set up the authentication middleware. The session timeout behavior is a security vs. UX trade-off - should sessions auto-extend on activity, or have a hard timeout? This affects both security posture and user experience.\n\nRequest: In auth/middleware.ts, implement the handleSessionTimeout() function to define the timeout behavior.\n\nGuidance: Consider: auto-extending improves UX but may leave sessions open longer; hard timeouts are more secure but might frustrate active users.\n\n## Balance\n\nDon't request contributions for:\n- Boilerplate or repetitive code\n- Obvious implementations with no meaningful choices\n- Configuration or setup code\n- Simple CRUD operations\n\nDo request contributions when:\n- There are meaningful trade-offs to consider\n- The decision shapes the feature's behavior\n- Multiple valid approaches exist\n- The user's domain knowledge would improve the solution\n\n## Explanatory Mode\n\nAdditionally, provide educational insights about the codebase as you help with tasks. Be clear and educational, providing helpful explanations while remaining focused on the task. Balance educational content with task completion.\n\n### Insights\nBefore and after writing code, provide brief educational explanations about implementation choices using:\n\n\"`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`\n[2-3 key educational points]\n`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`\"\n\nThese insights should be included in the conversation, not in the codebase. Focus on interesting insights specific to the codebase or the code you just wrote, rather than general programming concepts. Provide insights as you write code, not just at the end.","<EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>\nYou have superpowers.\n\n**Below is the full content of your 'superpowers:using-superpowers' skill - your introduction to using skills. For all other skills, use the 'Skill' tool:**\n\n---\nname: using-superpowers\ndescription: Use when starting any conversation - establishes how to find and use skills, requiring Skill tool invocation before ANY response including clarifying questions\n---\n\n<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>\nIf you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke the skill.\n\nIF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.\n\nThis is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.\n</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>\n\n## How to Access Skills\n\n**In Claude Code:** Use the `Skill` tool. When you invoke a skill, its content is loaded and presented to you—follow it directly. Never use the Read tool on skill files.\n\n**In other environments:** Check your platform's documentation for how skills are loaded.\n\n# Using Skills\n\n## The Rule\n\n**Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill might apply means that you should invoke the skill to check. If an invoked skill turns out to be wrong for the situation, you don't need to use it.\n\n```dot\ndigraph skill_flow {\n    \"User message received\" [shape=doublecircle];\n    \"Might any skill apply?\" [shape=diamond];\n    \"Invoke Skill tool\" [shape=box];\n    \"Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'\" [shape=box];\n    \"Has checklist?\" [shape=diamond];\n    \"Create TodoWrite todo per item\" [shape=box];\n    \"Follow skill exactly\" [shape=box];\n    \"Respond (including clarifications)\" [shape=doublecircle];\n\n    \"User message received\" -> \"Might any skill apply?\";\n    \"Might any skill apply?\" -> \"Invoke Skill tool\" [label=\"yes, even 1%\"];\n    \"Might any skill apply?\" -> \"Respond (including clarifications)\" [label=\"definitely not\"];\n    \"Invoke Skill tool\" -> \"Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'\";\n    \"Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'\" -> \"Has checklist?\";\n    \"Has checklist?\" -> \"Create TodoWrite todo per item\" [label=\"yes\"];\n    \"Has checklist?\" -> \"Follow skill exactly\" [label=\"no\"];\n    \"Create TodoWrite todo per item\" -> \"Follow skill exactly\";\n}\n```\n\n## Red Flags\n\nThese thoughts mean STOP—you're rationalizing:\n\n| Thought | Reality |\n|---------|---------|\n| \"This is just a simple question\" | Questions are tasks. Check for skills. |\n| \"I need more context first\" | Skill check comes BEFORE clarifying questions. |\n| \"Let me explore the codebase first\" | Skills tell you HOW to explore. Check first. |\n| \"I can check git/files quickly\" | Files lack conversation context. Check for skills. |\n| \"Let me gather information first\" | Skills tell you HOW to gather information. |\n| \"This doesn't need a formal skill\" | If a skill exists, use it. |\n| \"I remember this skill\" | Skills evolve. Read current version. |\n| \"This doesn't count as a task\" | Action = task. Check for skills. |\n| \"The skill is overkill\" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |\n| \"I'll just do this one thing first\" | Check BEFORE doing anything. |\n| \"This feels productive\" | Undisciplined action wastes time. Skills prevent this. |\n| \"I know what that means\" | Knowing the concept ≠ using the skill. Invoke it. |\n\n## Skill Priority\n\nWhen multiple skills could apply, use this order:\n\n1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, debugging) - these determine HOW to approach the task\n2. **Implementation skills second** (frontend-design, mcp-builder) - these guide execution\n\n\"Let's build X\" → brainstorming first, then implementation skills.\n\"Fix this bug\" → debugging first, then domain-specific skills.\n\n## Skill Types\n\n**Rigid** (TDD, debugging): Follow exactly. Don't adapt away discipline.\n\n**Flexible** (patterns): Adapt principles to context.\n\nThe skill itself tells you which.\n\n## User Instructions\n\nInstructions say WHAT, not HOW. \"Add X\" or \"Fix Y\" doesn't mean skip workflows.\n\n\n</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>"],"hookName":"SessionStart","toolUseID":"SessionStart","hookEvent":"SessionStart","timestamp":"2026-01-31T20:10:53.352Z","parentUuid":"f3552a14-db2b-4335-9d62-0599114edff3","sessionId":"15f0c8a8-9cdc-4227-8e69-d93b42bde30e","cwd":"/Users/russelltsherman/src/github.com/russelltsherman/dot/config/assistant","userType":"external","version":"2.1.27","isSidechain":false,"gitBranch":"main"}

Plugin marketplaces are catalogs that help you discover and install these extensions without building them yourself.\n\nLooking to create and distribute your own marketplace? See [Create and distribute a plugin marketplace](/en/plugin-marketplaces).\n\n## How marketplaces work\n\nA marketplace is a catalog of plugins that someone else has created and shared. Using a marketplace is a two-step process:\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Add the marketplace\">\n    This registers the catalog with Claude Code so you can browse what's available. No plugins are installed yet.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Install individual plugins\">\n    Browse the catalog and install the plugins you want.\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\nThink of it like adding an app store: adding the store gives you access to browse its collection, but you still choose which apps to download individually.\n\n## Official Anthropic marketplace\n\nThe official Anthropic marketplace (`claude-plugins-official`) is automatically available when you start Claude Code. Run `/plugin` and go to the **Discover** tab to browse what's available.\n\nTo install a plugin from the official marketplace:\n\n```shell  theme={null}\n/plugin install plugin-name@claude-plugins-official\n```\n\n<Note>\n  The official marketplace is maintained by Anthropic. To distribute your own plugins, [create your own marketplace](/en/plugin-marketplaces) and share it with users.\n</Note>\n\nThe official marketplace includes several categories of plugins:\n\n### Code intelligence\n\nCode intelligence plugins enable Claude Code's built-in LSP tool, giving Claude the ability to jump to definitions, find references, and see type errors immediately after edits. These plugins configure [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) connections, the same technology that powers VS Code's code intelligence.\n\nThese plugins require the language server binary to be installed on your system. If you already have a language server installed, Claude may prompt you to install the corresponding plugin when you open a project.\n\n| Language   | Plugin              | Binary required              |\n| :--------- | :------------------ | :--------------------------- |\n| C/C++      | `clangd-lsp`        | `clangd`                     |\n| C#         | `csharp-lsp`        | `csharp-ls`                  |\n| Go         | `gopls-lsp`         | `gopls`                      |\n| Java       | `jdtls-lsp`         | `jdtls`                      |\n| Kotlin     | `kotlin-lsp`        | `kotlin-language-server`     |\n| Lua        | `lua-lsp`           | `lua-language-server`        |\n| PHP        | `php-lsp`           | `intelephense`               |\n| Python     | `pyright-lsp`       | `pyright-langserver`         |\n| Rust       | `rust-analyzer-lsp` | `rust-analyzer`              |\n| Swift      | `swift-lsp`         | `sourcekit-lsp`              |\n| TypeScript | `typescript-lsp`    | `typescript-language-server` |\n\nYou can also [create your own LSP plugin](/en/plugins-reference#lsp-servers) for other languages.\n\n<Note>\n  If you see `Executable not found in $PATH` in the `/plugin` Errors tab after installing a plugin, install the required binary from the table above.\n</Note>\n\n#### What Claude gains from code intelligence plugins\n\nOnce a code intelligence plugin is installed and its language server binary is available, Claude gains two capabilities:\n\n* **Automatic diagnostics**: after every file edit Claude makes, the language server analyzes the changes and reports errors and warnings back automatically. Claude sees type errors, missing imports, and syntax issues without needing to run a compiler or linter. If Claude introduces an error, it notices and fixes the issue in the same turn. This requires no configuration beyond installing the plugin. You can see diagnostics inline by pressing **Ctrl+O** when the \"diagnostics found\" indicator appears.\n* **Code navigation**: Claude can use the language server to jump to definitions, find references, get type info on hover, list symbols, find implementations, and trace call hierarchies. These operations give Claude more precise navigation than grep-based search, though availability may vary by language and environment.\n\nIf you run into issues, see [Code intelligence troubleshooting](#code-intelligence-issues).\n\n### External integrations\n\nThese plugins bundle pre-configured [MCP servers](/en/mcp) so you can connect Claude to external services without manual setup:\n\n* **Source control**: `github`, `gitlab`\n* **Project management**: `atlassian` (Jira/Confluence), `asana`, `linear`, `notion`\n* **Design**: `figma`\n* **Infrastructure**: `vercel`, `firebase`, `supabase`\n* **Communication**: `slack`\n* **Monitoring**: `sentry`\n\n### Development workflows\n\nPlugins that add commands and agents for common development tasks:\n\n* **commit-commands**: Git commit workflows including commit, push, and PR creation\n* **pr-review-toolkit**: Specialized agents for reviewing pull requests\n* **agent-sdk-dev**: Tools for building with the Claude Agent SDK\n* **plugin-dev**: Toolkit for creating your own plugins\n\n### Output styles\n\nCustomize how Claude responds:\n\n* **explanatory-output-style**: Educational insights about implementation choices\n* **learning-output-style**: Interactive learning mode for skill building\n\n## Try it: add the demo marketplace\n\nAnthropic also maintains a [demo plugins marketplace](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins) (`claude-code-plugins`) with example plugins that show what's possible with the plugin system. Unlike the official marketplace, you need to add this one manually.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Add the marketplace\">\n    From within Claude Code, run the `plugin marketplace add` command for the `anthropics/claude-code` marketplace:\n\n    ```shell  theme={null}\n    /plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-code\n    ```\n\n    This downloads the marketplace catalog and makes its plugins available to you.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Browse available plugins\">\n    Run `/plugin` to open the plugin manager. This opens a tabbed interface with four tabs you can cycle through using **Tab** (or **Shift+Tab** to go backward):\n\n    * **Discover**: browse available plugins from all your marketplaces\n    * **Installed**: view and manage your installed plugins\n    * **Marketplaces**: add, remove, or update your added marketplaces\n    * **Errors**: view any plugin loading errors\n\n    Go to the **Discover** tab to see plugins from the marketplace you just added.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Install a plugin\">\n    Select a plugin to view its details, then choose an installation scope:\n\n    * **User scope**: install for yourself across all projects\n    * **Project scope**: install for all collaborators on this repository\n    * **Local scope**: install for yourself in this repository only\n\n    For example, select **commit-commands** (a plugin that adds git workflow commands) and install it to your user scope.\n\n    You can also install directly from the command line:\n\n    ```shell  theme={null}\n    /plugin install commit-commands@anthropics-claude-code\n    ```\n\n    See [Configuration scopes](/en/settings#configuration-scopes) to learn more about scopes.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Use your new plugin\">\n    After installing, the plugin's commands are immediately available. Plugin commands are namespaced by the plugin name, so **commit-commands** provides commands like `/commit-commands:commit`.\n\n    Try it out by making a change to a file and running:\n\n    ```shell  theme={null}\n    /commit-commands:commit\n    ```\n\n    This stages your changes, generates a commit message, and creates the commit.\n\n    Each plugin works differently. Check the plugin's description in the **Discover** tab or its homepage to learn what commands and capabilities it provides.\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\nThe rest of this guide covers all the ways you can add marketplaces, install plugins, and manage your configuration.\n\n## Add marketplaces\n\nUse the `/plugin marketplace add` command to add marketplaces from different sources.\n\n<Tip>\n  **Shortcuts**: You can use `/plugin market` instead of `/plugin marketplace`, and `rm` instead of `remove`.\n</Tip>\n\n* **GitHub repositories**: `owner/repo` format (for example, `anthropics/claude-code`)\n* **Git URLs**: any git repository URL (GitLab, Bitbucket, self-hosted)\n* **Local paths**: directories or direct paths to `marketplace.json` files\n* **Remote URLs**: direct URLs to hosted `marketplace.json` files\n\n### Add from GitHub\n\nAdd a GitHub repository that contains a `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` file using the `owner/repo` format—where `owner` is the GitHub username or organization and `repo` is the repository name.\n\nFor example, `anthropics/claude-code` refers to the `claude-code` repository owned by `anthropics`:\n\n```shell  theme={null}\n/plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-code\n```\n\n### Add from other Git hosts\n\nAdd any git repository by providing the full URL. This works with any Git host, including GitLab, Bitbucket, and self-hosted servers:\n\nUsing HTTPS:\n\n```shell  theme={null}\n/plugin marketplace add https://gitlab.com/company/plugins.git\n```\n\nUsing SSH:\n\n```shell  theme={null}\n/plugin marketplace add git@gitlab.com:company/plugins.git\n```\n\nTo add a specific branch or tag, append `#` followed by the ref:\n\n```shell  theme={null}\n/plugin marketplace add https://gitlab.com/company/plugins.git#v1.0.0\n```\n\n### Add from local paths\n\nAdd a local directory that contains a `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` file:\n\n```shell  theme={null}\n/plugin marketplace add ./my-marketplace\n```\n\nYou can also add a direct path to a `marketplace.json` file:\n\n```shell  theme={null}\n/plugin marketplace add ./path/to/marketplace.json\n```\n\n### Add from remote URLs\n\nAdd a remote `marketplace.json` file via URL:\n\n```shell  theme={null}\n/plugin marketplace add https://example.com/marketplace.json\n```\n\n<Note>\n  URL-based marketplaces have some limitations compared to Git-based marketplaces. If you encounter \"path not found\" errors when installing plugins, see [Troubleshooting](/en/plugin-marketplaces#plugins-with-relative-paths-fail-in-url-based-marketplaces).\n</Note>\n\n## Install plugins\n\nOnce you've added marketplaces, you can install plugins directly (installs to user scope by default):\n\n```shell  theme={null}\n/plugin install plugin-name@marketplace-name\n```\n\nTo choose a different [installation scope](/en/settings#configuration-scopes), use the interactive UI: run `/plugin`, go to the **Discover** tab, and press **Enter** on a plugin. You'll see options for:\n\n* **User scope** (default): install for yourself across all projects\n* **Project scope**: install for all collaborators on this repository (adds to `.claude/settings.json`)\n* **Local scope**: install for yourself in this repository only (not shared with collaborators)\n\nYou may also see plugins with **managed** scope—these are installed by administrators via [managed settings](/en/settings#settings-files) and cannot be modified.\n\nRun `/plugin` and go to the **Installed** tab to see your plugins grouped by scope.\n\n<Warning>\n  Make sure you trust a plugin before installing it. Anthropic does not control what MCP servers, files, or other software are included in plugins and cannot verify that they work as intended. Check each plugin's homepage for more information.\n</Warning>\n\n## Manage installed plugins\n\nRun `/plugin` and go to the **Installed** tab to view, enable, disable, or uninstall your plugins. Type to filter the list by plugin name or description.\n\nYou can also manage plugins with direct commands.\n\nDisable a plugin without uninstalling:\n\n```shell  theme={null}\n/plugin disable plugin-name@marketplace-name\n```\n\nRe-enable a disabled plugin:\n\n```shell  theme={null}\n/plugin enable plugin-name@marketplace-name\n```\n\nCompletely remove a plugin:\n\n```shell  theme={null}\n/plugin uninstall plugin-name@marketplace-name\n```\n\nThe `--scope` option lets you target a specific scope with CLI commands:\n\n```shell  theme={null}\nclaude plugin install formatter@your-org --scope project\nclaude plugin uninstall formatter@your-org --scope project\n```\n\n## Manage marketplaces\n\nYou can manage marketplaces through the interactive `/plugin` interface or with CLI commands.\n\n### Use the interactive interface\n\nRun `/plugin` and go to the **Marketplaces** tab to:\n\n* View all your added marketplaces with their sources and status\n* Add new marketplaces\n* Update marketplace listings to fetch the latest plugins\n* Remove marketplaces you no longer need\n\n### Use CLI commands\n\nYou can also manage marketplaces with direct commands.\n\nList all configured marketplaces:\n\n```shell  theme={null}\n/plugin marketplace list\n```\n\nRefresh plugin listings from a marketplace:\n\n```shell  theme={null}\n/plugin marketplace update marketplace-name\n```\n\nRemove a marketplace:\n\n```shell  theme={null}\n/plugin marketplace remove marketplace-name\n```\n\n<Warning>\n  Removing a marketplace will uninstall any plugins you installed from it.\n</Warning>\n\n### Configure auto-updates\n\nClaude Code can automatically update marketplaces and their installed plugins at startup. When auto-update is enabled for a marketplace, Claude Code refreshes the marketplace data and updates installed plugins to their latest versions. If any plugins were updated, you'll see a notification suggesting you restart Claude Code.\n\nToggle auto-update for individual marketplaces through the UI:\n\n1. Run `/plugin` to open the plugin manager\n2. Select **Marketplaces**\n3. Choose a marketplace from the list\n4. Select **Enable auto-update** or **Disable auto-update**\n\nOfficial Anthropic marketplaces have auto-update enabled by default. Third-party and local development marketplaces have auto-update disabled by default.\n\nTo disable all automatic updates entirely for both Claude Code and all plugins, set the `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` environment variable. See [Auto updates](/en/setup#auto-updates) for details.\n\nTo keep plugin auto-updates enabled while disabling Claude Code auto-updates, set `FORCE_AUTOUPDATE_PLUGINS=true` along with `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER`:\n\n```shell  theme={null}\nexport DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=true\nexport FORCE_AUTOUPDATE_PLUGINS=true\n```\n\nThis is useful when you want to manage Claude Code updates manually but still receive automatic plugin updates.\n\n## Configure team marketplaces\n\nTeam admins can set up automatic marketplace installation for projects by adding marketplace configuration to `.claude/settings.json`. When team members trust the repository folder, Claude Code prompts them to install these marketplaces and plugins.\n\nFor full configuration options including `extraKnownMarketplaces` and `enabledPlugins`, see [Plugin settings](/en/settings#plugin-settings).\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### /plugin command not recognized\n\nIf you see \"unknown command\" or the `/plugin` command doesn't appear:\n\n1. **Check your version**: Run `claude --version`. Plugins require version 1.0.33 or later.\n2. **Update Claude Code**:\n   * **Homebrew**: `brew upgrade claude-code`\n   * **npm**: `npm update -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`\n   * **Native installer**: Re-run the install command from [Setup](/en/setup)\n3. **Restart Claude Code**: After updating, restart your terminal and run `claude` again.\n\n### Common issues\n\n* **Marketplace not loading**: Verify the URL is accessible and that `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` exists at the path\n* **Plugin installation failures**: Check that plugin source URLs are accessible and repositories are public (or you have access)\n* **Files not found after installation**: Plugins are copied to a cache, so paths referencing files outside the plugin directory won't work\n* **Plugin skills not appearing**: Clear the cache with `rm -rf ~/.claude/plugins/cache`, restart Claude Code, and reinstall the plugin.\n\nFor detailed troubleshooting with solutions, see [Troubleshooting](/en/plugin-marketplaces#troubleshooting) in the marketplace guide. For debugging tools, see [Debugging and development tools](/en/plugins-reference#debugging-and-development-tools).\n\n### Code intelligence issues\n\n* **Language server not starting**: verify the binary is installed and available in your `$PATH`. Check the `/plugin` Errors tab for details.\n* **High memory usage**: language servers like `rust-analyzer` and `pyright` can consume significant memory on large projects. If you experience memory issues, disable the plugin with `/plugin disable <plugin-name>` and rely on Claude's built-in search tools instead.\n* **False positive diagnostics in monorepos**: language servers may report unresolved import errors for internal packages if the workspace isn't configured correctly. These don't affect Claude's ability to edit code.\n\n## Next steps\n\n* **Build your own plugins**: See [Plugins](/en/plugins) to create skills, agents, and hooks\n* **Create a marketplace**: See [Create a plugin marketplace](/en/plugin-marketplaces) to distribute plugins to your team or community\n* **Technical reference**: See [Plugins reference](/en/plugins-reference) for complete specifications\n"}]},"uuid":"31f199ff-1c00-4b5f-9aa2-3b91219f9304","timestamp":"2026-01-31T20:11:37.582Z"},"normalizedMessages":[],"type":"agent_progress","prompt":"The user asks: \"teach me about how to activate and use plugins within claude code\"\n\nPlease provide comprehensive information about:\n1.

Check first. |\n| \"I can check git/files quickly\" | Files lack conversation context. Check for skills. |\n| \"Let me gather information first\" | Skills tell you HOW to gather information. |\n| \"This doesn't need a formal skill\" | If a skill exists, use it. |\n| \"I remember this skill\" | Skills evolve. Read current version. |\n| \"This doesn't count as a task\" | Action = task. Check for skills. |\n| \"The skill is overkill\" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |\n| \"I'll just do this one thing first\" | Check BEFORE doing anything. |\n| \"This feels productive\" | Undisciplined action wastes time. Skills prevent this. |\n| \"I know what that means\" | Knowing the concept ≠ using the skill. Invoke it. |\n\n## Skill Priority\n\nWhen multiple skills could apply, use this order:\n\n1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, debugging) - these determine HOW to approach the task\n2. **Implementation skills second** (frontend-design, mcp-builder) - these guide execution\n\n\"Let's build X\" → brainstorming first, then implementation skills.\n\"Fix this bug\" → debugging first, then domain-specific skills.\n\n## Skill Types\n\n**Rigid** (TDD, debugging): Follow exactly. Don't adapt away discipline.\n\n**Flexible** (patterns): Adapt principles to context.\n\nThe skill itself tells you which.\n\n## User Instructions\n\nInstructions say WHAT, not HOW. \"Add X\" or \"Fix Y\" doesn't mean skip workflows.\n\n\n</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>"],"hookName":"SessionStart","toolUseID":"SessionStart","hookEvent":"SessionStart","timestamp":"2026-01-31T20:10:53.352Z","parentUuid":"31dc573c-a758-46e6-96a1-6ce63096679e","sessionId":"15f0c8a8-9cdc-4227-8e69-d93b42bde30e","cwd":"/Users/russelltsherman/src/github.com/russelltsherman/dot/config/assistant","userType":"external","version":"2.1.27","isSidechain":false,"gitBranch":"main"}

Install them from the official marketplace—search for \"lsp\" in the `/plugin` Discover tab. This section documents how to create LSP plugins for languages not covered by the official marketplace.\n</Tip>\n\nPlugins can provide [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) (LSP) servers to give Claude real-time code intelligence while working on your codebase.\n\nLSP integration provides:\n\n* **Instant diagnostics**: Claude sees errors and warnings immediately after each edit\n* **Code navigation**: go to definition, find references, and hover information\n* **Language awareness**: type information and documentation for code symbols\n\n**Location**: `.lsp.json` in plugin root, or inline in `plugin.json`\n\n**Format**: JSON configuration mapping language server names to their configurations\n\n**`.lsp.json` file format**:\n\n```json  theme={null}\n{\n  \"go\": {\n    \"command\": \"gopls\",\n    \"args\": [\"serve\"],\n    \"extensionToLanguage\": {\n      \".go\": \"go\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Inline in `plugin.json`**:\n\n```json  theme={null}\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-plugin\",\n  \"lspServers\": {\n    \"go\": {\n      \"command\": \"gopls\",\n      \"args\": [\"serve\"],\n      \"extensionToLanguage\": {\n        \".go\": \"go\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Required fields:**\n\n| Field                 | Description                                  |\n| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |\n| `command`             | The LSP binary to execute (must be in PATH)  |\n| `extensionToLanguage` | Maps file extensions to language identifiers |\n\n**Optional fields:**\n\n| Field                   | Description                                               |\n| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `args`                  | Command-line arguments for the LSP server                 |\n| `transport`             | Communication transport: `stdio` (default) or `socket`    |\n| `env`                   | Environment variables to set when starting the server     |\n| `initializationOptions` | Options passed to the server during initialization        |\n| `settings`              | Settings passed via `workspace/didChangeConfiguration`    |\n| `workspaceFolder`       | Workspace folder path for the server                      |\n| `startupTimeout`        | Max time to wait for server startup (milliseconds)        |\n| `shutdownTimeout`       | Max time to wait for graceful shutdown (milliseconds)     |\n| `restartOnCrash`        | Whether to automatically restart the server if it crashes |\n| `maxRestarts`           | Maximum number of restart attempts before giving up       |\n\n<Warning>\n  **You must install the language server binary separately.** LSP plugins configure how Claude Code connects to a language server, but they don't include the server itself. If you see `Executable not found in $PATH` in the `/plugin` Errors tab, install the required binary for your language.\n</Warning>\n\n**Available LSP plugins:**\n\n| Plugin           | Language server            | Install command                                                                            |\n| :--------------- | :------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `pyright-lsp`    | Pyright (Python)           | `pip install pyright` or `npm install -g pyright`                                          |\n| `typescript-lsp` | TypeScript Language Server | `npm install -g typescript-language-server typescript`                                     |\n| `rust-lsp`       | rust-analyzer              | [See rust-analyzer installation](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html#installation) |\n\nInstall the language server first, then install the plugin from the marketplace.\n\n***\n\n## Plugin installation scopes\n\nWhen you install a plugin, you choose a **scope** that determines where the plugin is available and who else can use it:\n\n| Scope     | Settings file                 | Use case                                                 |\n| :-------- | :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `user`    | `~/.claude/settings.json`     | Personal plugins available across all projects (default) |\n| `project` | `.claude/settings.json`       | Team plugins shared via version control                  |\n| `local`   | `.claude/settings.local.json` | Project-specific plugins, gitignored                     |\n| `managed` | `managed-settings.json`       | Managed plugins (read-only, update only)                 |\n\nPlugins use the same scope system as other Claude Code configurations.

they don't replace them.\n\n* If `commands/` exists, it's loaded in addition to custom command paths\n* All paths must be relative to plugin root and start with `./`\n* Commands from custom paths use the same naming and namespacing rules\n* Multiple paths can be specified as arrays for flexibility\n\n**Path examples**:\n\n```json  theme={null}\n{\n  \"commands\": [\n    \"./specialized/deploy.md\",\n    \"./utilities/batch-process.md\"\n  ],\n  \"agents\": [\n    \"./custom-agents/reviewer.md\",\n    \"./custom-agents/tester.md\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Environment variables\n\n**`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`**: Contains the absolute path to your plugin directory. Use this in hooks, MCP servers, and scripts to ensure correct paths regardless of installation location.\n\n```json  theme={null}\n{\n  \"hooks\": {\n    \"PostToolUse\": [\n      {\n        \"hooks\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"command\",\n            \"command\": \"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/process.sh\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n***\n\n## Plugin caching and file resolution\n\nFor security and verification purposes, Claude Code copies plugins to a cache directory rather than using them in-place. Understanding this behavior is important when developing plugins that reference external files.\n\n### How plugin caching works\n\nWhen you install a plugin, Claude Code copies the plugin files to a cache directory:\n\n* **For marketplace plugins with relative paths**: The path specified in the `source` field is copied recursively. For example, if your marketplace entry specifies `\"source\": \"./plugins/my-plugin\"`, the entire `./plugins` directory is copied.\n* **For plugins with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`**: The implicit root directory (the directory containing `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) is copied recursively.\n\n### Path traversal limitations\n\nPlugins cannot reference files outside their copied directory structure. Paths that traverse outside the plugin root (such as `../shared-utils`) will not work after installation because those external files are not copied to the cache.\n\n### Working with external dependencies\n\nIf your plugin needs to access files outside its directory, you have two options:\n\n**Option 1: Use symlinks**\n\nCreate symbolic links to external files within your plugin directory. Symlinks are honored during the copy process:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\n# Inside your plugin directory\nln -s /path/to/shared-utils ./shared-utils\n```\n\nThe symlinked content will be copied into the plugin cache.\n\n**Option 2: Restructure your marketplace**\n\nSet the plugin path to a parent directory that contains all required files, then provide the rest of the plugin manifest directly in the marketplace entry:\n\n```json  theme={null}\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-plugin\",\n  \"source\": \"./\",\n  \"description\": \"Plugin that needs root-level access\",\n  \"commands\": [\"./plugins/my-plugin/commands/\"],\n  \"agents\": [\"./plugins/my-plugin/agents/\"],\n  \"strict\": false\n}\n```\n\nThis approach copies the entire marketplace root, giving your plugin access to sibling directories.\n\n<Note>\n  Symlinks that point to locations outside the plugin's logical root are followed during copying. This provides flexibility while maintaining the security benefits of the caching system.\n</Note>\n\n***\n\n## Plugin directory structure\n\n### Standard plugin layout\n\nA complete plugin follows this structure:\n\n```\nenterprise-plugin/\n├── .claude-plugin/           # Metadata directory\n│   └── plugin.json          # Required: plugin manifest\n├── commands/                 # Default command location\n│   ├── status.md\n│   └── logs.md\n├── agents/                   # Default agent location\n│   ├── security-reviewer.md\n│   ├── performance-tester.md\n│   └── compliance-checker.md\n├── skills/                   # Agent Skills\n│   ├── code-reviewer/\n│   │   └── SKILL.md\n│   └── pdf-processor/\n│       ├── SKILL.md\n│       └── scripts/\n├── hooks/                    # Hook configurations\n│   ├── hooks.json           # Main hook config\n│   └── security-hooks.json  # Additional hooks\n├── .mcp.json                # MCP server definitions\n├── .lsp.json                # LSP server configurations\n├── scripts/                 # Hook and utility scripts\n│   ├── security-scan.sh\n│   ├── format-code.py\n│   └── deploy.js\n├── LICENSE                  # License file\n└── CHANGELOG.md             # Version history\n```\n\n<Warning>\n  The `.claude-plugin/` directory contains the `plugin.json` file.

details:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nclaude --debug\n```\n\nThis shows:\n\n* Which plugins are being loaded\n* Any errors in plugin manifests\n* Command, agent, and hook registration\n* MCP server initialization\n\n### Common issues\n\n| Issue                               | Cause                           | Solution                                                                          |\n| :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Plugin not loading                  | Invalid `plugin.json`           | Validate JSON syntax with `claude plugin validate` or `/plugin validate`          |\n| Commands not appearing              | Wrong directory structure       | Ensure `commands/` at root, not in `.claude-plugin/`                              |\n| Hooks not firing                    | Script not executable           | Run `chmod +x script.sh`                                                          |\n| MCP server fails                    | Missing `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` | Use variable for all plugin paths                                                 |\n| Path errors                         | Absolute paths used             | All paths must be relative and start with `./`                                    |\n| LSP `Executable not found in $PATH` | Language server not installed   | Install the binary (e.g., `npm install -g typescript-language-server typescript`) |\n\n### Example error messages\n\n**Manifest validation errors**:\n\n* `Invalid JSON syntax: Unexpected token } in JSON at position 142`: check for missing commas, extra commas, or unquoted strings\n* `Plugin has an invalid manifest file at .claude-plugin/plugin.json. Validation errors: name: Required`: a required field is missing\n* `Plugin has a corrupt manifest file at .claude-plugin/plugin.json. JSON parse error: ...`: JSON syntax error\n\n**Plugin loading errors**:\n\n* `Warning: No commands found in plugin my-plugin custom directory: ./cmds. Expected .md files or SKILL.md in subdirectories.`: command path exists but contains no valid command files\n* `Plugin directory not found at path: ./plugins/my-plugin. Check that the marketplace entry has the correct path.`: the `source` path in marketplace.json points to a non-existent directory\n* `Plugin my-plugin has conflicting manifests: both plugin.json and marketplace entry specify components.`: remove duplicate component definitions or set `strict: true` in marketplace entry\n\n### Hook troubleshooting\n\n**Hook script not executing**:\n\n1. Check the script is executable: `chmod +x ./scripts/your-script.sh`\n2. Verify the shebang line: First line should be `#!/bin/bash` or `#!/usr/bin/env bash`\n3. Check the path uses `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`: `\"command\": \"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/your-script.sh\"`\n4. Test the script manually: `./scripts/your-script.sh`\n\n**Hook not triggering on expected events**:\n\n1. Verify the event name is correct (case-sensitive): `PostToolUse`, not `postToolUse`\n2. Check the matcher pattern matches your tools: `\"matcher\": \"Write|Edit\"` for file operations\n3. Confirm the hook type is valid: `command`, `prompt`, or `agent`\n\n### MCP server troubleshooting\n\n**Server not starting**:\n\n1. Check the command exists and is executable\n2. Verify all paths use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` variable\n3. Check the MCP server logs: `claude --debug` shows initialization errors\n4. Test the server manually outside of Claude Code\n\n**Server tools not appearing**:\n\n1. Ensure the server is properly configured in `.mcp.json` or `plugin.json`\n2. Verify the server implements the MCP protocol correctly\n3. Check for connection timeouts in debug output\n\n### Directory structure mistakes\n\n**Symptoms**: Plugin loads but components (commands, agents, hooks) are missing.\n\n**Correct structure**: Components must be at the plugin root, not inside `.claude-plugin/`. Only `plugin.json` belongs in `.claude-plugin/`.\n\n```\nmy-plugin/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   └── plugin.json      ← Only manifest here\n├── commands/            ← At root level\n├── agents/              ← At root level\n└── hooks/               ← At root level\n```\n\nIf your components are inside `.claude-plugin/`, move them to the plugin root.\n\n**Debug checklist**:\n\n1. Run `claude --debug` and look for \"loading plugin\" messages\n2. Check that each component directory is listed in the debug output\n3. Verify file permissions allow reading the plugin files\n\n***\n\n## Distribution and versioning reference\n\n### Version management\n\nFollow semantic versioning for plugin releases:\n\n```json  theme={null}\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-plugin\",\n  \"version\": \"2.1.0\"\n}\n```\n\n**Version format**: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`\n\n* **MAJOR**: Breaking changes (incompatible API changes)\n* **MINOR**: New features (backward-compatible additions)\n* **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backward-compatible fixes)\n\n**Best practices**:\n\n* Start at `1.0.0` for your first stable release\n* Update the version in `plugin.json` before distributing changes\n* Document changes in a `CHANGELOG.md` file\n* Use pre-release versions like `2.0.0-beta.1` for testing\n\n***\n\n## See also\n\n* [Plugins](/en/plugins) - Tutorials and practical usage\n* [Plugin marketplaces](/en/plugin-marketplaces) - Creating and managing marketplaces\n* [Skills](/en/skills) - Skill development details\n* [Subagents](/en/sub-agents) - Agent configuration and capabilities\n* [Hooks](/en/hooks) - Event handling and automation\n* [MCP](/en/mcp) - External tool integration\n* [Settings](/en/settings) - Configuration options for plugins\n"}]},"uuid":"d1bb9f96-b784-45ae-98ca-c6c694bef867","timestamp":"2026-01-31T20:11:38.025Z"},"normalizedMessages":[],"type":"agent_progress","prompt":"The user asks: \"teach me about how to activate and use plugins within claude code\"\n\nPlease provide comprehensive information about:\n1.

This mode differs from the original unshipped Learning output style by also incorporating explanatory functionality.\n\n## Learning Mode Philosophy\n\nInstead of implementing everything yourself, identify opportunities where the user can write 5-10 lines of meaningful code that shapes the solution. Focus on business logic, design choices, and implementation strategies where their input truly matters.\n\n## When to Request User Contributions\n\nRequest code contributions for:\n- Business logic with multiple valid approaches\n- Error handling strategies\n- Algorithm implementation choices\n- Data structure decisions\n- User experience decisions\n- Design patterns and architecture choices\n\n## How to Request Contributions\n\nBefore requesting code:\n1. Create the file with surrounding context\n2. Add function signature with clear parameters/return type\n3. Include comments explaining the purpose\n4. Mark the location with TODO or clear placeholder\n\nWhen requesting:\n- Explain what you've built and WHY this decision matters\n- Reference the exact file and prepared location\n- Describe trade-offs to consider, constraints, or approaches\n- Frame it as valuable input that shapes the feature, not busy work\n- Keep requests focused (5-10 lines of code)\n\n## Example Request Pattern\n\nContext: I've set up the authentication middleware. The session timeout behavior is a security vs. UX trade-off - should sessions auto-extend on activity, or have a hard timeout? This affects both security posture and user experience.\n\nRequest: In auth/middleware.ts, implement the handleSessionTimeout() function to define the timeout behavior.\n\nGuidance: Consider: auto-extending improves UX but may leave sessions open longer; hard timeouts are more secure but might frustrate active users.\n\n## Balance\n\nDon't request contributions for:\n- Boilerplate or repetitive code\n- Obvious implementations with no meaningful choices\n- Configuration or setup code\n- Simple CRUD operations\n\nDo request contributions when:\n- There are meaningful trade-offs to consider\n- The decision shapes the feature's behavior\n- Multiple valid approaches exist\n- The user's domain knowledge would improve the solution\n\n## Explanatory Mode\n\nAdditionally, provide educational insights about the codebase as you help with tasks. Be clear and educational, providing helpful explanations while remaining focused on the task. Balance educational content with task completion.\n\n### Insights\nBefore and after writing code, provide brief educational explanations about implementation choices using:\n\n\"`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`\n[2-3 key educational points]\n`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`\"\n\nThese insights should be included in the conversation, not in the codebase. Focus on interesting insights specific to the codebase or the code you just wrote, rather than general programming concepts. Provide insights as you write code, not just at the end.","<EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>\nYou have superpowers.\n\n**Below is the full content of your 'superpowers:using-superpowers' skill - your introduction to using skills.

YOU MUST USE IT.\n\nThis is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.\n</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>\n\n## How to Access Skills\n\n**In Claude Code:** Use the `Skill` tool. When you invoke a skill, its content is loaded and presented to you—follow it directly. Never use the Read tool on skill files.\n\n**In other environments:** Check your platform's documentation for how skills are loaded.\n\n# Using Skills\n\n## The Rule\n\n**Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill might apply means that you should invoke the skill to check. If an invoked skill turns out to be wrong for the situation, you don't need to use it.\n\n```dot\ndigraph skill_flow {\n    \"User message received\" [shape=doublecircle];\n    \"Might any skill apply?\" [shape=diamond];\n    \"Invoke Skill tool\" [shape=box];\n    \"Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'\" [shape=box];\n    \"Has checklist?\" [shape=diamond];\n    \"Create TodoWrite todo per item\" [shape=box];\n    \"Follow skill exactly\" [shape=box];\n    \"Respond (including clarifications)\" [shape=doublecircle];\n\n    \"User message received\" -> \"Might any skill apply?\";\n    \"Might any skill apply?\" -> \"Invoke Skill tool\" [label=\"yes, even 1%\"];\n    \"Might any skill apply?\" -> \"Respond (including clarifications)\" [label=\"definitely not\"];\n    \"Invoke Skill tool\" -> \"Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'\";\n    \"Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'\" -> \"Has checklist?\";\n    \"Has checklist?\" -> \"Create TodoWrite todo per item\" [label=\"yes\"];\n    \"Has checklist?\" -> \"Follow skill exactly\" [label=\"no\"];\n    \"Create TodoWrite todo per item\" -> \"Follow skill exactly\";\n}\n```\n\n## Red Flags\n\nThese thoughts mean STOP—you're rationalizing:\n\n| Thought | Reality |\n|---------|---------|\n| \"This is just a simple question\" | Questions are tasks. Check for skills. |\n| \"I need more context first\" | Skill check comes BEFORE clarifying questions. |\n| \"Let me explore the codebase first\" | Skills tell you HOW to explore. Check first. |\n| \"I can check git/files quickly\" | Files lack conversation context. Check for skills. |\n| \"Let me gather information first\" | Skills tell you HOW to gather information. |\n| \"This doesn't need a formal skill\" | If a skill exists, use it. |\n| \"I remember this skill\" | Skills evolve. Read current version. |\n| \"This doesn't count as a task\" | Action = task. Check for skills. |\n| \"The skill is overkill\" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |\n| \"I'll just do this one thing first\" | Check BEFORE doing anything. |\n| \"This feels productive\" | Undisciplined action wastes time. Skills prevent this. |\n| \"I know what that means\" | Knowing the concept ≠ using the skill. Invoke it. |\n\n## Skill Priority\n\nWhen multiple skills could apply, use this order:\n\n1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, debugging) - these determine HOW to approach the task\n2. **Implementation skills second** (frontend-design, mcp-builder) - these guide execution\n\n\"Let's build X\" → brainstorming first, then implementation skills.\n\"Fix this bug\" → debugging first, then domain-specific skills.\n\n## Skill Types\n\n**Rigid** (TDD, debugging): Follow exactly. Don't adapt away discipline.\n\n**Flexible** (patterns): Adapt principles to context.\n\nThe skill itself tells you which.\n\n## User Instructions\n\nInstructions say WHAT, not HOW. \"Add X\" or \"Fix Y\" doesn't mean skip workflows.\n\n\n</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>"],"hookName":"SessionStart","toolUseID":"SessionStart","hookEvent":"SessionStart","timestamp":"2026-01-31T20:10:53.352Z","parentUuid":"206fee1b-2c32-4541-864b-b5728c1fd575","sessionId":"15f0c8a8-9cdc-4227-8e69-d93b42bde30e","cwd":"/Users/russelltsherman/src/github.com/russelltsherman/dot/config/assistant","userType":"external","version":"2.1.27","isSidechain":false,"gitBranch":"main"}

Now I have comprehensive information about Claude Code plugins. Let me provide you with a complete guide.\n\n## Comprehensive Guide to Claude Code Plugins\n\nClaude Code plugins are extensions that add custom functionality including skills, agents, hooks, and MCP server integrations. Here's everything you need to know:\n\n### 1. What Are Claude Code Plugins?\n\nPlugins are packages that extend Claude Code with reusable functionality you can share across projects and teams. They can include:\n\n- **Skills/Commands**: Custom `/command` shortcuts you can invoke\n- **Agents**: Specialized subagents for specific tasks\n- **Hooks**: Event handlers that respond to Claude Code lifecycle events\n- **MCP Servers**: Integrations with external tools and services\n- **LSP Servers**: Language intelligence (go to definition, find references, type info)\n\n**Key difference**: Plugins use namespaced commands (e.g., `/my-plugin:hello`) to avoid conflicts when multiple plugins have skills with the same name.\n\n### 2. Discovering Plugins\n\nThe **official Anthropic marketplace** is automatically available and includes plugins across multiple categories:\n\n- **Code Intelligence**: LSP plugins for TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go, Java, C/C++, and more\n- **External Integrations**: GitHub, GitLab, Linear, Notion, Slack, Figma, Vercel, Firebase, and others\n- **Development Workflows**: Git commit tools, PR review kits, Agent SDK tools\n- **Output Styles**: Customization for how Claude responds\n\nBrowse available plugins with:\n\n```bash\n/plugin\n```\n\nThis opens a tabbed interface:\n- **Discover tab**: Browse all available plugins\n- **Installed tab**: View and manage installed plugins\n- **Marketplaces tab**: Add/remove marketplaces and configure auto-updates\n- **Errors tab**: View plugin loading errors\n\n### 3. Installing Plugins\n\n#### Using the Interactive Interface\n\n```bash\n/plugin\n```\n\nNavigate to **Discover**, select a plugin, press Enter, and choose your installation scope (user, project, or local).\n\n#### Using CLI Commands\n\n```bash\n# Install to user scope (default, available across all projects)\nclaude plugin install plugin-name@marketplace-name\n\n# Install to project scope (shared with team via version control)\nclaude plugin install plugin-name@marketplace-name --scope project\n\n# Install to local scope (project-specific, gitignored)\nclaude plugin install plugin-name@marketplace-name --scope local\n```\n\n**Installation scopes**:\n- **User**: `~/.claude/settings.json` - available everywhere\n- **Project**: `.claude/settings.json` - shared with team\n- **Local**: `.claude/settings.local.json` - project-specific, private\n\n### 4. Using Plugins Once Activated\n\nAfter installation, plugin commands are immediately available:\n\n```bash\n/plugin-name:command-name\n```\n\nSkills within plugins work two ways:\n\n1. **User-invoked**: You explicitly run `/plugin-name:skill-name`\n2. **Auto-invoked**: Claude automatically uses skills based on task context\n\nWhen a plugin provides agents, they appear in:\n\n```bash\n/agents\n```\n\n### 5. Managing Plugin Marketplaces\n\n#### Adding Marketplaces\n\nMarketplaces are catalogs of plugins. The official one is automatic, but you can add more:\n\n```bash\n# From GitHub (owner/repo format)\n/plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-code\n\n# From other Git hosts (GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.)\n/plugin marketplace add https://gitlab.com/company/plugins.git\n\n# From local paths\n/plugin marketplace add ./my-marketplace\n\n# From remote URLs\n/plugin marketplace add https://example.com/marketplace.json\n\n# Specific branch/tag\n/plugin marketplace add https://gitlab.com/company/plugins.git#v1.0.0\n```\n\n#### Managing Marketplaces\n\n```bash\n# List all marketplaces\n/plugin marketplace list\n\n# Update/refresh marketplace listings\n/plugin marketplace update marketplace-name\n\n# Remove a marketplace\n/plugin marketplace remove marketplace-name\n\n# Toggle auto-updates for a marketplace\n# Use `/plugin` interface → Marketplaces tab → Select marketplace → Enable/Disable auto-update\n```\n\n### 6. Managing Installed Plugins\n\n```bash\n# Disable a plugin (without uninstalling)\n/plugin disable plugin-name@marketplace-name\n\n# Re-enable a disabled plugin\n/plugin enable plugin-name@marketplace-name\n\n# Update a plugin to latest version\n/plugin update plugin-name@marketplace-name\n\n# Completely remove a plugin\n/plugin uninstall plugin-name@marketplace-name\n# Aliases: remove, rm\n```\n\n### 7. Common Plugins in Official Marketplace\n\n**Code Intelligence (LSP)**:\n- `typescript-lsp` - TypeScript/JavaScript\n- `pyright-lsp` - Python\n- `rust-analyzer-lsp` - Rust\n- `gopls-lsp` - Go\n- Plus plugins for Java, C/C++, C#, and more\n\n**Development Workflows**:\n- `commit-commands` - Git commit, push, PR creation\n- `pr-review-toolkit` - Specialized PR review agents\n- `agent-sdk-dev` - Claude Agent SDK tools\n- `plugin-dev` - Plugin creation toolkit\n\n**External Services**:\n- `github`, `gitlab` - Source control\n- `linear`, `asana`, `atlassian` - Project management\n- `slack` - Communication\n- `figma` - Design\n- `vercel`, `firebase`, `supabase` - Infrastructure\n\n**Output Customization**:\n- `explanatory-output-style` - Educational responses\n- `learning-output-style` - Interactive learning mode\n\n### 8. CLI Commands Reference\n\n```bash\n# Installation\nclaude plugin install <plugin>@<marketplace> [--scope user|project|local]\nclaude plugin uninstall <plugin>@<marketplace> [--scope user|project|local]\n\n# Management\nclaude plugin enable <plugin>@<marketplace> [--scope user|project|local]\nclaude plugin disable <plugin>@<marketplace> [--scope user|project|local]\nclaude plugin update <plugin>@<marketplace> [--scope user|project|local]\n\n# Marketplaces\n/plugin marketplace add <source>\n/plugin marketplace remove <marketplace-name>\n/plugin marketplace list\n/plugin marketplace update <marketplace-name>\n```\n\n### 9. Configuring Plugin Settings\n\nPlugins can be configured in your settings files:\n\n**User scope** (`~/.claude/settings.json`):\n```json\n{\n  \"enabledPlugins\": {\n    \"plugin-name@marketplace\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Project scope** (`.claude/settings.json`):\n```json\n{\n  \"extraKnownMarketplaces\": [\n    \"https://github.com/company/plugins\"\n  ],\n  \"enabledPlugins\": {\n    \"plugin-name@marketplace\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 10. Code Intelligence Plugins Details\n\nWhen you install a code intelligence plugin (LSP):\n\n1. The plugin must have the language server binary installed on your system\n2. After installation, Claude gets:\n   - **Automatic diagnostics**: Claude sees errors immediately after each edit\n   - **Code navigation**: Jump to definitions, find references, get type info\n\nIf you see \"Executable not found in $PATH\" error:\n- Install the required binary (e.g., `npm install -g typescript-language-server typescript`)\n- Restart Claude Code\n\n### 11. Creating Your Own Plugins\n\nYou can create custom plugins to share with your team or community:\n\n```bash\n# Create plugin directory\nmkdir my-plugin\nmkdir -p my-plugin/.claude-plugin\n\n# Create manifest\ncat > my-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json << 'EOF'\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-plugin\",\n  \"description\": \"Custom plugin description\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"author\": { \"name\": \"Your Name\" }\n}\nEOF\n\n# Add a skill\nmkdir -p my-plugin/skills/hello\ncat > my-plugin/skills/hello/SKILL.md << 'EOF'\n---\ndescription: Greet the user with a friendly message\n---\n\nGreet the user warmly and ask how you can help them today.\nEOF\n\n# Test locally\nclaude --plugin-dir ./my-plugin\n```\n\n### 12. Troubleshooting\n\n**Plugin command not recognized**:\n- Update Claude Code: `brew upgrade claude-code` or `npm update -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`\n- Requires version 1.0.33 or later: `claude --version`\n\n**Marketplace not loading**:\n- Verify URL accessibility and that `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` exists\n\n**Plugin installation failures**:\n- Check plugin source URLs are accessible\n- For private repos, ensure you have access\n\n**Language server not starting**:\n- Install the required binary: `pip install pyright`, `npm install -g typescript-language-server`, etc.\n- Check `/plugin` Errors tab for details\n\n**High memory usage**:\n- Language servers can consume memory on large projects\n- Disable with: `/plugin disable plugin-name@marketplace-name`\n\n### Your Current Setup\n\nLooking at your configuration in `/Users/russelltsherman/.config/assistant/settings.json`, I see you have these enabled plugins:\n\n```json\n\"enabledPlugins\": {\n  \"linear@claude-plugins-official\": true,\n  \"github@claude-plugins-official\": true,\n  \"ralph-loop@claude-plugins-official\": true,\n  \"commit-commands@claude-plugins-official\": true,\n  \"superpowers@claude-plugins-official\": true,\n  \"Notion@claude-plugins-official\": true,\n  \"code-review@claude-plugins-official\": true,\n  \"feature-dev@claude-plugins-official\": true,\n  \"context7@claude-plugins-official\": true,\n  \"hookify@claude-plugins-official\": true,\n  \"learning-output-style@claude-plugins-official\": true,\n  \"slack@claude-plugins-official\": true\n}\n```\n\nThese are active and ready to use with their namespaced commands (e.g., `/commit-commands:commit`, `/superpowers:brainstorm`).\n\n---\n\nSources:\n- [Claude Code Plugins Guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins.md)\n- [Discover and Install Plugins](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/discover-plugins.md)\n- [Plugins Reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference.md)\n- [Claude Code Documentation Map](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/claude_code_docs_map.md)"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a24541f (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)"}]}]},"uuid":"e57baa43-f165-4ef4-bbe8-02bbc1a74075","timestamp":"2026-01-31T20:12:02.270Z","toolUseResult":{"status":"completed","prompt":"The user asks: \"teach me about how to activate and use plugins within claude code\"\n\nPlease provide comprehensive information about:\n1.

This mode differs from the original unshipped Learning output style by also incorporating explanatory functionality.\n\n## Learning Mode Philosophy\n\nInstead of implementing everything yourself, identify opportunities where the user can write 5-10 lines of meaningful code that shapes the solution. Focus on business logic, design choices, and implementation strategies where their input truly matters.\n\n## When to Request User Contributions\n\nRequest code contributions for:\n- Business logic with multiple valid approaches\n- Error handling strategies\n- Algorithm implementation choices\n- Data structure decisions\n- User experience decisions\n- Design patterns and architecture choices\n\n## How to Request Contributions\n\nBefore requesting code:\n1. Create the file with surrounding context\n2. Add function signature with clear parameters/return type\n3. Include comments explaining the purpose\n4. Mark the location with TODO or clear placeholder\n\nWhen requesting:\n- Explain what you've built and WHY this decision matters\n- Reference the exact file and prepared location\n- Describe trade-offs to consider, constraints, or approaches\n- Frame it as valuable input that shapes the feature, not busy work\n- Keep requests focused (5-10 lines of code)\n\n## Example Request Pattern\n\nContext: I've set up the authentication middleware. The session timeout behavior is a security vs. UX trade-off - should sessions auto-extend on activity, or have a hard timeout? This affects both security posture and user experience.\n\nRequest: In auth/middleware.ts, implement the handleSessionTimeout() function to define the timeout behavior.\n\nGuidance: Consider: auto-extending improves UX but may leave sessions open longer; hard timeouts are more secure but might frustrate active users.\n\n## Balance\n\nDon't request contributions for:\n- Boilerplate or repetitive code\n- Obvious implementations with no meaningful choices\n- Configuration or setup code\n- Simple CRUD operations\n\nDo request contributions when:\n- There are meaningful trade-offs to consider\n- The decision shapes the feature's behavior\n- Multiple valid approaches exist\n- The user's domain knowledge would improve the solution\n\n## Explanatory Mode\n\nAdditionally, provide educational insights about the codebase as you help with tasks. Be clear and educational, providing helpful explanations while remaining focused on the task. Balance educational content with task completion.\n\n### Insights\nBefore and after writing code, provide brief educational explanations about implementation choices using:\n\n\"`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`\n[2-3 key educational points]\n`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`\"\n\nThese insights should be included in the conversation, not in the codebase. Focus on interesting insights specific to the codebase or the code you just wrote, rather than general programming concepts. Provide insights as you write code, not just at the end.","<EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>\nYou have superpowers.\n\n**Below is the full content of your 'superpowers:using-superpowers' skill - your introduction to using skills. For all other skills, use the 'Skill' tool:**\n\n---\nname: using-superpowers\ndescription: Use when starting any conversation - establishes how to find and use skills, requiring Skill tool invocation before ANY response including clarifying questions\n---\n\n<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>\nIf you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke the skill.\n\nIF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.\n\nThis is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.\n</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>\n\n## How to Access Skills\n\n**In Claude Code:** Use the `Skill` tool. When you invoke a skill, its content is loaded and presented to you—follow it directly. Never use the Read tool on skill files.\n\n**In other environments:** Check your platform's documentation for how skills are loaded.\n\n# Using Skills\n\n## The Rule\n\n**Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill might apply means that you should invoke the skill to check. If an invoked skill turns out to be wrong for the situation, you don't need to use it.\n\n```dot\ndigraph skill_flow {\n    \"User message received\" [shape=doublecircle];\n    \"Might any skill apply?\" [shape=diamond];\n    \"Invoke Skill tool\" [shape=box];\n    \"Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'\" [shape=box];\n    \"Has checklist?\" [shape=diamond];\n    \"Create TodoWrite todo per item\" [shape=box];\n    \"Follow skill exactly\" [shape=box];\n    \"Respond (including clarifications)\" [shape=doublecircle];\n\n    \"User message received\" -> \"Might any skill apply?\";\n    \"Might any skill apply?\" -> \"Invoke Skill tool\" [label=\"yes, even 1%\"];\n    \"Might any skill apply?\" -> \"Respond (including clarifications)\" [label=\"definitely not\"];\n    \"Invoke Skill tool\" -> \"Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'\";\n    \"Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'\" -> \"Has checklist?\";\n    \"Has checklist?\" -> \"Create TodoWrite todo per item\" [label=\"yes\"];\n    \"Has checklist?\" -> \"Follow skill exactly\" [label=\"no\"];\n    \"Create TodoWrite todo per item\" -> \"Follow skill exactly\";\n}\n```\n\n## Red Flags\n\nThese thoughts mean STOP—you're rationalizing:\n\n| Thought | Reality |\n|---------|---------|\n| \"This is just a simple question\" | Questions are tasks. Check for skills. |\n| \"I need more context first\" | Skill check comes BEFORE clarifying questions. |\n| \"Let me explore the codebase first\" | Skills tell you HOW to explore. Check first. |\n| \"I can check git/files quickly\" | Files lack conversation context. Check for skills. |\n| \"Let me gather information first\" | Skills tell you HOW to gather information. |\n| \"This doesn't need a formal skill\" | If a skill exists, use it. |\n| \"I remember this skill\" | Skills evolve. Read current version. |\n| \"This doesn't count as a task\" | Action = task. Check for skills. |\n| \"The skill is overkill\" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |\n| \"I'll just do this one thing first\" | Check BEFORE doing anything. |\n| \"This feels productive\" | Undisciplined action wastes time. Skills prevent this. |\n| \"I know what that means\" | Knowing the concept ≠ using the skill. Invoke it. |\n\n## Skill Priority\n\nWhen multiple skills could apply, use this order:\n\n1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, debugging) - these determine HOW to approach the task\n2. **Implementation skills second** (frontend-design, mcp-builder) - these guide execution\n\n\"Let's build X\" → brainstorming first, then implementation skills.\n\"Fix this bug\" → debugging first, then domain-specific skills.\n\n## Skill Types\n\n**Rigid** (TDD, debugging): Follow exactly.

Don't adapt away discipline.\n\n**Flexible** (patterns): Adapt principles to context.\n\nThe skill itself tells you which.\n\n## User Instructions\n\nInstructions say WHAT, not HOW. \"Add X\" or \"Fix Y\" doesn't mean skip workflows.\n\n\n</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>"],"hookName":"SessionStart","toolUseID":"SessionStart","hookEvent":"SessionStart","timestamp":"2026-01-31T20:10:53.352Z","parentUuid":"70582803-8342-403e-a3ef-702a53b41be7","sessionId":"15f0c8a8-9cdc-4227-8e69-d93b42bde30e","cwd":"/Users/russelltsherman/src/github.com/russelltsherman/dot/config/assistant","userType":"external","version":"2.1.27","isSidechain":false,"gitBranch":"main"}
