However, I should clarify something important:\n\n**I don't have a \"plugins system\" in the traditional sense.** As Claude (Anthropic's AI), I work differently than browser-based tools like ChatGPT that have plugin ecosystems.\n\nWhat I *can* help you with:\n\n1. **Claude.dev / VS Code Extension** - If you're using the Claude extension for VS Code, I can explain its features and capabilities\n\n2. **API Integration** - How to build tools that integrate with Claude's API\n\n3. **Custom Tools/Skills** - I have access to specific tools (like `keybindings-help` shown above) for particular tasks\n\n4. **External Integrations** - How to connect Claude with other services via API\n\n**Could you clarify what you're trying to do?**\n- Are you using Claude in VS Code?\n- Do you want to integrate Claude with external tools/APIs?\n- Are you looking for information about a specific plugin or integration?\n- Are you trying to customize Claude's behavior for a particular workflow?\n\nOnce I understand your specific goal, I can give you much more targeted guidance! 🎯"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":414,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXg41fQfLpsMCGaVcT66r","type":"assistant","uuid":"667a5ea3-1b07-4b62-8845-ab53978e56a2","timestamp":"2026-01-31T20:02:28.045Z"}
